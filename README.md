# BigBalls

Update submodules by doing this from the terminal in the directory of the project:

`git submodule init`
`git submodule update`

To use Xcode, install Arduino; it must be installed in /Applications. Install "teensyduino" (the teensy add on for Arduino). Build/Upload targets should work.

To use Arduino, copy the Libraries submodules to your Libraries folder. Then open BigBalls.ino and build.

See "Ball Orientation Side View" and "Ball Orientation Top View" to get a feel for how I'm orienting things.
