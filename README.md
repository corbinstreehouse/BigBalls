# BigBalls

Update submodules by doing this from the terminal in the directory of the project:

git submodule init
git submodule update

To use Xcode, install Arduino; it must be installed in /Applications. Install "teensyduino" (the teensy add on for Arduino). Build/Upload targets should work.

To use Arduino, copy the Libraries submodules to your Libraries foldre. Then open BigBalls.ino and build.
